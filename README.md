## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. `git clone git@github.com:Igor1901/Neobis_iOS_StopWatch.git`.

## StopWatch
The stopwatch mode includes three primary buttons and a display field for showing the elapsed time. The buttons are as follows:

* Start: Initiates the stopwatch, starting the count and displaying the elapsed time.
* Pause: Pauses the stopwatch, allowing users to continue from the paused time by pressing the Start button.
* Stop: Stops the stopwatch and resets the elapsed time to zero.

## Timer
The timer mode also features three buttons, a field for displaying the remaining time, and an input field for setting the desired time. The buttons in timer mode are:

* Start: Commences the countdown based on the time set in the input field.
* Pause: Pauses the timer countdown, allowing users to resume from the paused time by pressing the Start button.
* Stop: Stops the timer countdown and resets it to the originally set time.
